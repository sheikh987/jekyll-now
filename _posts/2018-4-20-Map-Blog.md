If you want to learn how to represent data with colors using google maps, this blog is for you.




I had to make an app that uses colors to represent data on differnet districs in a state.
And I couldn't find a way to extarct a certain state from google maps(I had to use google maps for reasons that is not part of this blog). 
Also, I couldn't find a way to get a list of latitude and longitude for a particular district. so, I used openSteetMaps to get the latLng data.



After reading this blog you would be able to 

* extract data from openStreetMaps
* use latLngs to create polygons
* represent data in the form of colors


Lets use some python.

Cretae a file called **_extract.py_**

Copy the code below into **_extract.py_** and save it


```python

import requests
import json
r = requests.get('http://polygons.openstreetmap.fr/get_poly.py?id={}&params=0'.format(1942920))
ccs = [{"lat" : i.split('\t')[1:][1], "long": i.split('\t')[1:][0]} for i in r.text.split('\n')[2:-3]]
json.dumps(ccs)

with open('test.json', 'w') as f:
     f.write(json.dumps(ccs))

```

open [openStreetmaps](https://www.openstreetmap.org)
