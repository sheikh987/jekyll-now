If you want to learn how to represent data with colors using google maps, this blog is for you.




I had to make an app that uses colors to represent data on differnet districs in a state.
And I couldn't find a way to extarct a certain state from google maps(I had to use google maps for reasons that is not part of this blog). 
Also, I couldn't find a way to get a list of latitude and longitude for a particular district. so, I used openSteetMaps to get the latLng data.



After reading this blog you would be able to 

* extract data from openStreetMaps
* use latLngs to create polygons
* represent data in the form of colors


Lets use some python.

Cretae a file called _extract.py_
Copy the code below into _extract.py_ and save it
