I had to make an app that uses colors to represent data on differnet districs in a state.
And I couldn't find a way to extarct a certain state from google maps(I had to use google maps for reasons that is not part of this blog). 
Also, I couldn't find a way to get a list of latitude and longitude for a particular district. so, I used openSteetMaps to get the latLng data.
